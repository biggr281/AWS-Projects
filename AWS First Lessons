First day in AWS Management Console

IAM - Making a user with ADMIN permissions
Logged onto Root to access IAM to enable MFA and create a new user

Access IAM from the search bar, then click on the left side USER, and then Create User.
Then submit the requested information including IAM user management and autogenerate password.

In Step three of the permissions, to make a new admin group click "Create New Group" and enter Admin into the "User Group Name" then select AdministratorAccess to give nearly all permissions that root user has.
Add tags if you wish and then proceed to create user.

When signing into the new user, when prompted to enter a new password it is advised to use a secure password generator with 48 characters including difficult symbols and characters

Final thoughts. I didn't have the same screen and options as the tutorial I was watching online. I will have to reference the course I have coming up in a few days to ensure I properly understand how to implement all features required to make a successful user.
I am currently getting an error as follows that I need to figure out.:
User: arn:aws:iam::381492189932:user/WilliamBiggar
Service: servicecatalog
Action: ListApplications
On resource(s): arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-2:381492189932:/applications/*

AWS Region Selector

Typically the Region is defaulted to Ohio or US East 2. But we should swap it to US East 1 so that we get access to original features. Billing and such will only show up in US East 1.
Other services like Cloud Front are global services. Additionally S3 is global but EC2 is exclusive to US East 1.

Overbilling 
Benefit - Utilizes Metered Billing, however it can be a double edge sword and can become very expensive if left unattended
An example - ElastiCache - Redis Instance - The guy was trying to store a single value but AWS likes to put the Node type as cache l6g large (13.07GB) as a default
Cost of l6g large (13.07GB) is 0.206 per hour. 0.206*730 (730 is the amount of time in a month) equates to $150 dollars of spending.

If this happens you can go to customer support and create a case in the Billing and "Charge Inquiry" section. If you explain nicely to customer support that the error was made they will typically give you a free pass on the first time and warn you
that in the future the bill will remain.

AWS Budgets
Type Budget in search and select AWS Budgets
The first two AWS actions are free

Before making a budget ensure that on root account IAM user and role access to Billing Information is set to Active. This can be found in Account > Billing and Payments and scrolling down to find the option

Navigate to Billing Console > Budgets > Create budget

SNS Notifications
Many things can be connected to send SNS to email etc for updates and changes

AWS Free Tier - First 12 months
To learn about all the features go to google and search "AWS Free Tier Details"
Some features are only available the first two months
To check if you are still in the AWS Free Tier navigate to Billing and Cost Management > Billing Preferences > then select Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts and enter an email address to receive updates
Also turn on Billing alerts - I didn't find the way to do that it may be deprecated 

Billing Alarm - Old way but recommended because of flexability 
They do cost money
CloudWatch - Billing - Alarms - Set rules to establish the alarm and arrange for email to have notifications sent

Root User - Multifactor Authentication
IAM - Front page set up MF authentication
Put device name and then select an option. Personally I use athenticator app
Download authenticator app to verify by scanning QR code provided and giving two required keys

Innovation waves
Kondratieve waves (aka Innovation Waves or K-Waves) are hypothosized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy. The phenomenon is closely connected with Technology life cycles. 
It is made up of four stages Prosperity, recession, depression, improvement

Burning platform
a term used when a company abandons old technology for new technology with the uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear that the organizations future survival hinges on its digital transformation

Digital Transformation Checklist
High level white paper to allow information to share with executives and key decision makers to determine what is required to make required digital changes to the organization

Evolution of Computing Power
General computing (Xeon CPU Processor) - Elastic Compute Cloud EC2, GPU Computing (roughly 50 times faster than traditional CPUs) - AWS Inferentiare (Inf1), Quantum Computing (D-Wave 2000Q, Rigetti 16q Aspen-4, IonQ linear ion trap, 100 million times faster)

Amazon Braket - Quantum Computing - AWS list is missing both Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery as important benefits

The Six Advantages of the Cloud - Defined by AWS (original descriptionf of Cloud Benefits

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
You can Pay On-Demand meaning there is no upfront-cost and you pay for only what you consume or pay by the hour, minutes or seconds.
Instead of paying for upfront costs of data centers and servers
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
You are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings.
Hundreds of thousands of customers utilizing a fraction of a server
3. Scale up or down to meet the current need. Launch and destroy services whenever
Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers
4. Increase speed and agility
Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes
Instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
Focus on your own customers, developing and configuring your applications
Instead of operations such as racking, stacking, and powering servers
6. Go global in minutes
Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks
Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customer at minimal cost

The Six Advantages of Cloud Doc Reference
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html

Updated - The Benefits of the Cloud - The Seven Advantages of Cloud
1. Cost-effective
Yuo pay for what you consume, no up-front cost. On-demand pricing or Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) with thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources
2. Global 
Launch workloads anywhere in the world. Just choose a region
3. Secure
Cloud provider takes care of physical security. Cloud services can be secure by default or you have the ability to configure access down to a granular level.
4. Reliable
Data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, and fault tolerance
5. Scalable
Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
6. Elastic 
Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand
7. Current
The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and replaced by the cloud provider without interruption to you

AWS Global Infrastructure
What is it?
The AWS Global Infrastructure is globally distributed hardware and datacenters that are physically networked together to act as one large resource for the end customer

The AWS Global Infrastructure is made up of the following resources:
- 33 Launched Regions
- 105 Availability Zones
- 115 Direct Connection Locations
- 600+ Points of Presence
- 41 Local Zone
- 29 Wavelength Zones

Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/

When a new area is first opened the Availability Zones should be at a minimum 3 because that is how you achieve high availability

Regions
Regions are geographically distinct locations consisting of one or more Availability Zones.
- Every region is physically isolated from an independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply

Each region generally has three Availability Zones
- Some new users are limited to two eg. US-West 
- New services are almost always available first in US-EAST
- Not all AWS Services are available in all regions
- All your billing inforamtion appears in US-EAST-1 (North Virginia)
- The cost of AWS services vary per region

When you choose a region there are four factors you need to consider:
1. What Regulatory compliance does this region meet?
2. What is the cost of AWS services in this region?
3. What AWS services are available in this region?
4. What is the distance or latency to my end-users?

Regions vs Global Services
Regional Services
AWS scopes their AWS Management Console on a selected Region.
- This will determine where an AWS service will be launched and what will be seen within an AWS Service's console
- You generally don't explicitly set the Region for a service at the time of creation
Global Services
Some AWS Services operate across multiple regions and the region will be fixed to "Global" e.g. Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route53, IAM
For these global services at the time of creation:
- There is no concept of region (IAM User)
- A single region must be explicitly chosen (S3 Bucket)
- A group of regions are chosen (CloudFront Distribution)

Availability Zones (AZs)
An Availability Zone (AZ) is physical location made up of one or more datacenter

A datacenter is a secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers.

A region will generally* contain 3 Availability Zones

Datacenters within a region will be isolated from each other (different buildings). But they will be close enough to provide low-latency (<10ms).

Its common practice to run workloads in at least 3 AZs to ensure services remain available in case one or two datacenters fail. (High Availability)

AZs are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier eg. us-east-1a

A Subnet is associated with an Availability Zone

You never choose the AZ when launching resources. You choose the Subnet with is associated to the AZ.

****Selecting regions and AZs - Instructuions weren't super clear in video please referene timestamp roughly 2:20:00

Fault Tolerance
What is a fault domain?
A fault domain is a section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device or system fails. The purpose of a fault domain is that if a failure occurs it will not cascade outside that domain, limiting the damage possible.

You can have fault domains nested inside fault domains

What is a fault level?
A fault level is a collection of fault domains
- An AWS Region would be a Fault level - Fault Level = us-east-1 (region)
- A Availability Zone would be a Fault Domain - Fault Domain = us-east-1a (AZ), Fault Domain = usa-east-b (AZ)

The scope of a fault domain could be:
- specific servers in a rack
- an entire rack in a data center
- an entire room in a datacenter
- the entire data center building
It's up the the Cloud Service Provider (CSPs) to define the boundaries of a domain

Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon Regions.
- This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability
Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency links
Each Availability Zone is designed as an independent failure zone
- A "Failure Zone" is AWS describing a Fault Domain

Failure Zone
- Availability Zones are physically separated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower risk flood plains
- discrete uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and onsite backup generation facilities
- data centers located in different Availability Zones are designed to be supplied by independent substations to reduce the risk of an event oon the power grid impacting more than one Availability Zone
- Availability Zones are all redundantly conencted to multiple tier-1 transit providers

Multi-AZ for High Availability
If an appklication is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more

AWS Global Network
The AWS Global Network represent the interconnections between AWS Global Infrastructure. Commonly referred to as the "Backbone of AWS'. Think of it as private expressway, where things can move very fast between datacenters
Edge Locations can act as on and off ramps to the AWS Global Network
  On Ramps - AWS Global Accelerator, AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration - Uses Edge Locations as an on-ramp to quickly reach AWS resources in other regions by travsersing the fast AWS Global Network
  Off Ramps - Amazon CloudFront (CDN) - Uses Edge Locations as an off-ramp, to provide at the Edge storage and compute near the end user.
              VPC Endpoints - Ensuring your resources stay within the AWS Network and do not traverse over the public Internet

Global Infrastructure - Points of Presence (PoP)
Is an intermediate location between an AWS Region and the end user, and this location could be a datacenter or collection of hardware.
  For AWS a Point of Presence is a datacenter owned by AWS or a trusted partner that is utilized by AWS Service related for content delivery or expediated upload
PoP resources are:
- Edge Locations
- Regional Edge caches
Edge Locations are datacenters that hold cached (copy) on the most popular files (eg web pages, images, and videos) so that the delivery of distance to the end users are reduced
Regional Edge Locations aer datacenters that hold much larger caches of less-popular files to reduce a full round trip and also to reduce the cost of transfer fees
PoPs live at the edge/intersection of two networks

Tier 1
Tier 1 Network is a network that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering
AWS Availability Zones are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

AWS Services using PoPs
The following AWS Services use PoPs for content delivery or expediated upload

Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery network (CDN) service that:
- You point your website to CloudFront so that it will route requests to nearest Edge Location cache
- allows you to choose an origin (such as a web-server or storage) that will be source of cached
- caches the contents of what origin would returned to various Edge Locations around the world

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration allows you to generate a special URL that can be used by end users to upload files to nearby Edge Location. Once a file is uploaded to an Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3

AWS Global Acceslerator can find the optimal path from the end user to your web-servers. Global Accelerator are deployed within Edge Locations so you send user traffic to an Edge Location instead of directly to your web-application

AWS Direct Connect
is a private (doesn't mean secure)/dedicated connection between your datacenter, office, co-location and AWS

Direct Connect has two very-fast network connection options:
1. Lower Bandwidth 50MBps-500MBps
2. Higher Bandwidth 1GBps or 10 GBps

A colocation (aka carrier-hotel_ is a data center where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers

It Helps reduce network costs and increase bandwidth throughpout (great for high traffic networks)
It provides a more consistent network experience than a typical internet-based connection. (reliable and secure)

Direct Connect Locations
Direct connect Locations are trusted partnered datacenters that you can establish a dedicated high speed, low-latency connection from your on-premise to AWS
You would yuse the AWS Direct connect service to order and establish a connection

Local Zones
are datacenters located very close to a densely populated area to provide single-digit millisecond low latency performance (eg 7ms) for that area
- LA, california was the first Local Zone to be deployed
  - It is a logical extension of the US-West Region
  - The Identifier looks like the following: us-west-2-lax-1a
- Only specific AWS Services have been made available
  - EC2 Instance Types (T3, C5, R5, R5d, l3en, G4)
  = EBS (io1 and gp2)
  - Amazon FSx
  - Application Load Balancer
  - Amazon VPC

The purpose of Local Zone is they support highly-demanding applications sensitive to latencies:
- Media and Entertainment
- Electronic Design Automation
- Ad-Tech
- Machine Learning

Wavelength Zones
allows for edge-computing on 5G networks. Applications will have ultra-low latency being as close as possible to the users

AWS has partnered with various Telecom companies to utilize their 5G networks, such as: verizon, KDDI, vodafone, SK telecom

You create a Subnet tied to a Wavelength zone and then you can launch Virtual Machines (VMs) to the edge of the targeted 5G Networks

Data Residency
Is the physical or geographic location of where an organization or cloud resources reside.

Compliance Boundaries: A regulatory compliance (legal requirement) by a government or organization that describes where data and cloud resources are allowed to reside.

Data Sovereignty: Data Sovereignty is the jurisdictional control or legal authority that can be asserted over data because it's physical location is within jurisdictional boundaries

For workloads that need to meet compliance boundaries strictly defining the data residency of data and cloud resources in AWS you can use:
- AWS Outposts is physical rack of servers that you can put in your data center. Your data will reside wherever the Outpost Physicall resides
- AWS Config: a Policy as Code service. You can create rules for continuous check AWS resources configuration. If they deviate from your expectations you are alerted or AWS Config can in some cases auto-remediate
- IAM Policies: can be written explicitly deny acess to specific AWS Regions. A Service Control Policy (SCP) are permissions applied organization wide.

AWS For Government
Public Sector includes military, law enforcement, infrastructure, public transit, public education, health care, the government itself
AWS can be utilized by public sector or organizations developing cloud workloads for the public sector
AWS achieves this by meeting regulatory compliance programs along with specific governance for security controls
Compliance Bodies: HIPAA, FedRAMP, CJIS, FIPS
AWS has special regions for US regulation called GovCloud

GovCloud 
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
a US government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessments, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

What is GovCloud?
A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) generally will offer an isolated region to run FedRAMP workloads.

AWS GovCloud Regions allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information and other types of regulated workloads.
- GovCloud Regions are only operated by employees who are US citizens, on US soil.
- They are only accessible to US entities and root account holders who pass a screening process
Customers can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with:
- FedRAMP High baseline
- DOJs Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy
- US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
- Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
- Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide

AWS in China
AWS China is the AWS cloud offerings in Mainland China.
  AWS China is completely isolated intentionally from AWS Global to
  meet regulatory compliance for Mainland China
  AWS China is on its own domain at: amazonaws.cn

In order to operate in a AWS China Region you need to have a Chinese Business License (ICP license)
Not all services are available in China (eg Route53)
Running in Mainland China (insetad of Singapore) means you will not need to traverse The Great Firewall

AWS has two Regions in Mainland china:
Ningxia CN-NorthWest-1 Operated by NSWCF
Beijing CN-North-1 operated by SINNET

Sustainability
Amazon co-founded the Climate Pledge to achieve Net_Zero Carbon Emissions by 2040 across all of Amazon's business (this includes AWS) sustainability.aboutamazon.com

AWS Cloud's Sustainability goals are composed of three parts:
1. Renewable Energy
AWS is working towards having their AWS Global Infrastructure powered by 100% renewable energy by 2025
2. Cloud Efficieny
AWS infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median of US enterprise data centers surveyed (could be heavly skewed)
3. Water Stewardship
Direct evaporative technology to cool the data centers
Use of non-potable water for cooling purposes (recycled water)
On site water treatment allows us to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles
Water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS Region

AWS Ground Station
is a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, process data, and scale your operations without having to worry about building or managing your own ground station infrastructure
Use Cases for Ground Station: weather forcasting, surface imaging, communications, video broadcasts
To use Ground Station:
- CYou schedule a Contact (select stellite, start and end time ,and the ground location)
- use the AWS Ground Station EC2 AMI to launch EC2 instances that will uplink and downlink data during the contact or receive downlink data in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Use Case: A company reaches an agreement with a Satellite Imagery Provider to take stellite photos of a specific region. They use AWS Ground Station to communicate that company's Satellite and download the S3 image data.

AWS Outposts
is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructuer, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premise facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.
AWS Outposts is rack of servers running AWS Infrastructure on your physical location
Server Rack: A frame design t ohold and organize IT equipment
Rack Heights: U stands for "rack units" or "U spaces" which is equal to 1.75 inches. The industry standard rack size is 48U(7 Foot Rack)
Full-size rack cage is 42U high
- equipment is typically 1U, 2U, 3U, or 4U high
AWS Outposts comse in 3 form factors: 42U, 1U and 2U
42U -AWS delivers the server to your preferred physical site fully assembled and ready to be rolled into final position. It is installed by AWS and the rack needs to be simply plugged into power and network

Both 1U and 2U are servers that you can place into your existing Racks:
1U suitable for 19-inch wide
24-inch deep cabinets
AWS Graviton2 (up to 64 vCPUs)
128 GiB memory
4 TB of local NVMe storage

2U suitable for 19-inch wide
36-inch deep cabinets,
Intel processor (up to 128 vCPUs)
256 GiB memory
8TB of local NVMe storage

Cloud Architecture Terminology
Solutions Architect: A role in a technocal organization that architects a technical solution using multiple systems via researching, documentation, experimentation
Cloud Architect: A solution architect that is focused solely on architecting technical solutions using cloud services.

A cloud architect needs to understand the following terms and factor them into their designed architecture based on the business requirements
- Availability - Your ability to ensure a service remains available eg Highly Avaible (HA)
- Scalability - Your ability to grow rapidly or unimpeded
- Elasticity - Your ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand
- Faulth Tolerance - Your ability to prevent a failure
- Disaster Recovery - Your ability to recover from a failure eg Highly Durable (DR)

A solutions architect needs to always consider teh following business factors:
- (Security) How secure is this solution?
- (Cost) How much is this going to cost?

1. High Availability
Your ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is *no single point of failure and/or ensure a certain level of performance
Running your workload across multiple Availability Zones ensures that if 1 or 2 AZs become unavailable your service / applications remains available.
Elastic Load Balancer: A load balancer allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more datacenter. If a datacenter or server becomes unavailable (unhealthy) the load balancer will route the traffic to only available datacenters with servers.

2. High Scalability 
Your ability to increase your capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power
Vertical Scaling: Scaling Up - Upgrade to a bigger server
Horizontal Scaling: Scaling Out - Add more servers of the same size

3. High Elasticity
Your abiltiy to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power
Horizontal Scaling
  Scaling Out - Add more servers of thes ame size
  Scaling In - Removing underutilized servers of the same size
Vertical Scaling is generally hard for traditional architecture so you'll usually only see horizontal scaling described with Elasticity
Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) is an AWS feature that will automatically add or remove servers based on scaling rules you define based on metrics

4. Fault Tolerance
Your ability for your service to ensure there is no single point of failure. Preventing the chance of failure
Failovers is when you have a plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case the primary system fails
A common example is having a comy (secondary) of your database where all ongoing changes are synced. The secondary system is not in-use until a fail over occurs and it becomes the primary database.
RDS Multi-AZ is when you run a duplicate standby database in another Availability Zone in case your primary database fails.

5. High Durability
Your ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data Solutions that recover from a disaster is known as Disaster Recovery (DR)
- Do you have a backup?
- How fast can you restore that backup?
- Does your backup still work?
- How do you ensure current live data is not corrupt?
CloudEndure Disaster Recovery continuously replicates your machines into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and preferred Region enabling fast and reliable recovery in case of IT data center failures

Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
A business continuity plan (BCP) is a document that outlines how a business will continue operating during an unplanned disruption in services
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): the maximum aacceptable amount of data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident, expressed as an amount of time. (How much data are you willing to lose)
Recovery Time objective (RTO): the maximum amount of downtime your business can tolerate without incurring a significant financial loss (How much time are you willing to go down?)

Disaster Recovery Options
There are multiple options for recovery that trade cost vs time to recover
Backup and Restore - RPO/RTO - Hours - You backup your data and restore it to new infrastructure
  - Lower priority use cases
  - Restore data after event
  - Deploy resources after event
  - Cost $
Pilot Light - RPO/RTO - 10 minutes - Data is replicated to another region with the minimal services running
  - Less stringent RPO/RTO
  - Core Services
  - Start and scale resources after event
  - Cost $$
Warm Standby - RPO/RTO - Minutes - Scaled down copy of your infrastructure running ready to scale up
  - Business Critical Services
  - Scale resources after event
  - Cost $$$
Multi-site Active/active - RPO/RTO - Real-time - Scaled up copy of your infrastructure in another region
  - Zero downtime
  - Near zero loss
  - Mission critical services
  - cost $$$$

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This objective determines what is considered an acceptable time windown when service is unavailable and is defined by the organization

Recovery Point objective (RPO)
is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This objective determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service and is defined by the organization
