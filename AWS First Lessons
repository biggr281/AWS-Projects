First day in AWS Management Console

IAM - Making a user with ADMIN permissions
Logged onto Root to access IAM to enable MFA and create a new user

Access IAM from the search bar, then click on the left side USER, and then Create User.
Then submit the requested information including IAM user management and autogenerate password.

In Step three of the permissions, to make a new admin group click "Create New Group" and enter Admin into the "User Group Name" then select AdministratorAccess to give nearly all permissions that root user has.
Add tags if you wish and then proceed to create user.

When signing into the new user, when prompted to enter a new password it is advised to use a secure password generator with 48 characters including difficult symbols and characters

Final thoughts. I didn't have the same screen and options as the tutorial I was watching online. I will have to reference the course I have coming up in a few days to ensure I properly understand how to implement all features required to make a successful user.
I am currently getting an error as follows that I need to figure out.:
User: arn:aws:iam::381492189932:user/WilliamBiggar
Service: servicecatalog
Action: ListApplications
On resource(s): arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-2:381492189932:/applications/*

AWS Region Selector

Typically the Region is defaulted to Ohio or US East 2. But we should swap it to US East 1 so that we get access to original features. Billing and such will only show up in US East 1.
Other services like Cloud Front are global services. Additionally S3 is global but EC2 is exclusive to US East 1.

Overbilling 
Benefit - Utilizes Metered Billing, however it can be a double edge sword and can become very expensive if left unattended
An example - ElastiCache - Redis Instance - The guy was trying to store a single value but AWS likes to put the Node type as cache l6g large (13.07GB) as a default
Cost of l6g large (13.07GB) is 0.206 per hour. 0.206*730 (730 is the amount of time in a month) equates to $150 dollars of spending.

If this happens you can go to customer support and create a case in the Billing and "Charge Inquiry" section. If you explain nicely to customer support that the error was made they will typically give you a free pass on the first time and warn you
that in the future the bill will remain.

AWS Budgets
Type Budget in search and select AWS Budgets
The first two AWS actions are free

Before making a budget ensure that on root account IAM user and role access to Billing Information is set to Active. This can be found in Account > Billing and Payments and scrolling down to find the option

Navigate to Billing Console > Budgets > Create budget

SNS Notifications
Many things can be connected to send SNS to email etc for updates and changes

AWS Free Tier - First 12 months
To learn about all the features go to google and search "AWS Free Tier Details"
Some features are only available the first two months
To check if you are still in the AWS Free Tier navigate to Billing and Cost Management > Billing Preferences > then select Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts and enter an email address to receive updates
Also turn on Billing alerts - I didn't find the way to do that it may be deprecated 

Billing Alarm - Old way but recommended because of flexability 
They do cost money
CloudWatch - Billing - Alarms - Set rules to establish the alarm and arrange for email to have notifications sent

Root User - Multifactor Authentication
IAM - Front page set up MF authentication
Put device name and then select an option. Personally I use athenticator app
Download authenticator app to verify by scanning QR code provided and giving two required keys

Innovation waves
Kondratieve waves (aka Innovation Waves or K-Waves) are hypothosized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy. The phenomenon is closely connected with Technology life cycles. 
It is made up of four stages Prosperity, recession, depression, improvement

Burning platform
a term used when a company abandons old technology for new technology with the uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear that the organizations future survival hinges on its digital transformation

Digital Transformation Checklist
High level white paper to allow information to share with executives and key decision makers to determine what is required to make required digital changes to the organization

Evolution of Computing Power
General computing (Xeon CPU Processor) - Elastic Compute Cloud EC2, GPU Computing (roughly 50 times faster than traditional CPUs) - AWS Inferentiare (Inf1), Quantum Computing (D-Wave 2000Q, Rigetti 16q Aspen-4, IonQ linear ion trap, 100 million times faster), AWS Bracket
